Redrawn peepos
--------------

I am redrawing emotes I want to use that are too low resolution. This
started with a *peepoSad* emote that I wanted to use as a Telegram
sticker, later a *peepoBoomer* emote that I wanted to recolour
for my livestream channel.

I am including the Krita project files as well as a rendered PNG free to use.
